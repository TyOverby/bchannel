# bchannel
## The channels API that you wished you had.

`bchannel` is a wrapper around the rust channels that offers (in my opinion)
a better API.

[Api docs](http://tyoverby.com/bchannel/bchannel/)

Improvements:
 * None of the methods fail
 * Async by default
 * Possible to send an error as a way to close the channel
 * Multiple iterator methods.
